# credit-risk-classification

### In this challenge, will use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk.  Will use a dataset of historical lending activity from peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.  

# Overview of the Analysis

 1) loan size
 2) interest rate
 3) borrower's income
 4) debt to income
